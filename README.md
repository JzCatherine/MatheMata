## About
Mathemata is an offline learning game application designed to strengthen early mathematical skills. The app focuses on improving the understanding of "estimating and measuring length, mass, and capacity using non-standard units of measures", which is based on deped's mathematics 1 curriculum. The application is part of the knowledge channel's efforts to address the mathematical knowledge gap in the philippines by creating an engaging and fun learning environment. 

The app aims to address the mathematical knowledge gap in the philippines by providing an innovative approach to learning that is interactive, user-friendly, and effective. Mathemata offers a range of features that help students to practice and improve their skills in estimating and measuring length, mass, and capacity.


## MatheMata Features
1. **Practice mode** - this feature enables students to practice their mathematical skills before playing the challenge mode. It has three difficulty levels, namely easy, average, and hard, providing players with various challenges based on their skill level.
2. **Challenge mode** - this feature allows students to test their knowledge and skills in non-standard units of measurement through a series of challenging quizzes. The challenge mode has different categories: length, mass, and capacity.
3. **Progress tracking** - the app provides progress tracking through the score summary feature. This feature helps students to monitor their progress and identify areas where they need to improve.
4. **All in one mode** - this feature allows students to play all categories of the challenge mode in one session. This provides a comprehensive review of the lessons learned in the practice mode and the different categories in the challenge mode.
5. **Clear and user-friendly interface** - mathemata has a clear and user-friendly interface that provides a fun and engaging learning experience.
